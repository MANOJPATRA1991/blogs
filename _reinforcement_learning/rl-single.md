### Quickstartsss

Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.

### PrerequisitesPermalink

See requirements.

### InstructionsPermalink

```
Install a full Ruby development environment.
Install Jekyll and bundler gems.

gem install jekyll bundler

Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog.

jekyll new myblog

Change into your new directory.

cd myblog

Build the site and make it available on a local server.

bundle exec jekyll serve

Browse to http://localhost:4000
```

If you encounter any errors during this process, see the troubleshooting page. Also, make sure youâ€™ve installed the development headers and other prerequisites as mentioned on the requirements page.

Note: Installation might be different depending on your operating system. See our guides for OS specific instructions.
